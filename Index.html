    <h1>Artist of the Year Award</h1>    
    <p id="desc"> Every summer time, the announcement of the Artist of the Year Award 
        is held on this website. The nominees for this award incorporate artists from 
        all over the world. However, only three of them will be included in the final 
        round. The winner of the final round will be determined by the most votes 
        received within the given period. However, to build suspense, the names of the 
        nominees won't be shown, instead only the first letter of their names will be 
        revealed. </p>
